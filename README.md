# Excel_Superstore
Firstly, I had to wrangle and prepare the data in Excel. Cleaned the data as appropriate by removing duplicates, addressing nulls, and reformatting data types (e.g., string to date), selected only the columns that will be used in my analysis, added new columns for categorical or numerical data as appropriate using other features.

I also included Data Handling Summary in the clean version of the excel workbook to detail the steps undertaken for this project.


Next up: Analysis & Interpretation of Data 
Analysis of data using pivot charts and tables that are documented in the 'Analysis & Charts' sheet. Created visualizations to communicate findings to audience. Included recommendations in the presentation as well

Some insights uncovered:
- “Wrong item” and “Wrong Color” make up almost 50% of returns in Texas which tend to fall under Second Class and Standard Class shipping
- Customers who returned products and “did not give reasons” and stated “not needed” were about 49.7%
